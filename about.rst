title: About

I'm a Mexican mathematician that has been coding for more than 10 years.
I did my debut as programmer in a company in 2018 and I worked for 3
years using Haskell as the main language!

I have a master degree on math, with primary focus on proofs.

My personal interest are the programming languages (their tools,
theory and implementation).

I'm developing a programming language named `octizys`
